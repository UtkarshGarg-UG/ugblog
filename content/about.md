## Hi, I'm Utkarsh 👋

I'm a **Principal Applied Scientist at Microsoft**, where I design the technical roadmap for **Word Copilot** and build **agentic AI systems** that make document editing intelligent, controllable, and collaborative.

My work sits at the intersection of **LLM research, product engineering, and evaluation science** — translating cutting-edge ideas in multi-agent coordination, fine-tuning, and tool-calling into production-ready systems used by millions.

## 🧠 What I Work On

At Microsoft, I lead initiatives shaping the next generation of Word Copilot:

- **Agentic AI for Word** – architecting multi-agent orchestration systems that coordinate reasoning, planning, and editing inside the Word canvas.  
- **Vibe Writing Framework** – an HTML DOM–based editing engine that performs precise insert/update/delete operations at node-level granularity, powering Word Copilot’s real-time document editing.  
- **LLM Evaluation Science** – creator of **POET**, an offline prompt A/B and evaluation platform; established **LLM-as-Judge** protocols for deterministic validation.  
- **Fine-Tuning & Tool-Calling** – designed training pipelines that improved agent tool prediction accuracy.
- **Retrieval & Grounding (RAG)** – enhanced factual grounding with hybrid retrieval, entity disambiguation, and reranking, boosting Hit@K, MRR, and attribution accuracy.  
- **Safety & Hallucination Mitigation** – implemented *Reflexion-style verbal RL* for incremental content rewriting when blocked by safety filters.

## 💼 Previous Work

**OneAssist – Team Lead (2018–2021)**  
Built customer-facing AI systems from the ground up:  
- Designed a **customer care chatbot** using FAISS, Sentence Transformers, and Siamese networks — cutting agent transfers from 50% to under 15%.  
- Developed a **CNN-based crack detection pipeline** that reduced customer onboarding time from 23 hours to under 5 minutes.  
- Built a **Deep RL recommendation engine** to personalize app experiences using GPT-like autoregressive user embeddings.

**Polestar Solutions – Senior Data Scientist (2014–2018)**  
- Created an **analytical chatbot** that translated natural-language business questions into SQL queries using multitask learning.  
- Led a **delivery ETA prediction system** that improved accuracy to ±1 day for 82% of customers and cut support calls by 30%.
